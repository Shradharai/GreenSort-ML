# GreenSort ML: Smart Waste Classification System

**GreenSort ML** is a machine learning project aimed at automating waste sorting. The system classifies waste items (like plastic, paper, organic, etc.) into appropriate categories using image and/or text data, helping reduce human effort and improve recycling efficiency.

## Overview

GreenSort ML automates the waste classification process using machine learning models. It can be integrated into smart bins or recycling systems to detect and sort waste in real-time, minimizing manual intervention and improving recycling efficiency.

## Features

* Classifies waste into multiple categories (Plastic, Paper, Organic, Metal, etc.)
* Supports real-time predictions
* High accuracy with optimized ML models
* Provides detailed evaluation metrics
* Easy-to-use interface for deployment

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Languages:** Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * `scikit-learn` – ML model implementation
  * `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` – Deep learning (if applicable)
  * `pandas`, `numpy` – Data processing
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
* **Others:** OpenCV (for image processing, if using image data)
